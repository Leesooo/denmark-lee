            <th>- Computers in the 1600s
                In the 1600s, the idea of an analog computer became a little known. A computer was referred to a device that is used for mathematical and statistical calculations. It used the techniques of decimal, statistics and logarithmic expressions to compute values. Women were tasked with such calculations and computations. 
                
                1617: John Napier invented Napier Bones, a manual calculating apparatus. Napier bones was a handheld device that used to support multiplication and division. It was also known as Napier Rods.
                
                1642: Biase Pascal, a french mathematician invented Pascaline, which is also known as the world's first automated calculator. 
                
                1673: Gottfried Willhelm Liebniz invented Stepped Reckoner or Liebniz wheel, which was an improved version of Pascaline. This mechanical calculator could do basic calculations and was made of flat drums.

        <th>- Computers from the 1900-1950s
            1936: Alan Turing developed an idea for a universal machine, which he would call the Turing machine, that would be able to compute anything that is computable. The concept of modern computers was based on his idea.
            
            1937: A professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University, J.V. Atanasoff, attempts to build the first computer without cams, belts, gears, or shafts.
            
            1939: Bill Hewlett and David Packard found Hewlett-Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California. Their first project, the HP 200A Audio Oscillator, would rapidly become a popular piece of test equipment for engineers.
            
            In fact, Walt Disney Pictures would order eight to test recording equipment and speaker systems for 12 specially equipped theaters that showed Fantasia in 1940.

            <th> Also in 1939, Bell Telephone Laboratories completed The Complex Number Calculator, designed by George Stibitz.

                1941: Professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University J.V. Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry designed a computer that can solve 29 equations simultaneously. This is the first time a computer is able to house data within its own memory.
                
                That same year, German engineer Konrad Zuse created the Z3 computer, which used 2,300 relays, performed floating-point binary arithmetic, and had a 22-bit word length. This computer was eventually destroyed in a bombing raid in Berlin in 1943.
                
                Additionally, in 1941, Alan Turing and Harold Keen built the British Bombe, which decrypted Nazi ENIGMA-based military communications during World War II.
                
                1943: John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, professors at the University of Pennsylvania, built an Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC). This is considered to be the grandfather of digital computers, as it is made up of 18,000 vacuum tubes and fills up a 20-foot by 40-foot room.
                
                1944: J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the successor of ENIAC, known as Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer which was one of the earliest electronic computer that could process and store discrete data
                
                1951:  The first commercially produced digital computer, known as UNIVAC, was launched as a general purpose commercial computer for the US business economy.
